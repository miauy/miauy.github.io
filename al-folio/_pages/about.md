I'm a second-year student at the University of Miami, double-majoring in Computer Science (B.A.) and Immersive Media (B.S.C), with a minor in Economics, aiming for a career in Project/Product Management within the tech industry. As a Co-founder and Co-president of the University's first Professional Technology Fraternity, Kappa Theta Pi, I've refined my leadership, management, and technical skills, growing our membership and facilitating impactful projects. This role not only connected me with amazing, bright individuals contributing to my growth but also solidified my passion for project management.

Throughout my time in college I have explored various career paths that reflected my various interests and evolving skills. I pursued a finance internship at Invesco Ltd in Summer 2023, which, while insightful, redirected my focus towards project management, a field where I feel my skills and interests truly align. Leading KTP has been the cornerstone of my college experience, offering real-world experience in creating and managing a vibrant student organization.

Recently, I've taken a significant step towards my career goals by joining VESL Studio as a Project Manager, where I'm excited to further explore and contribute to innovative XR projects. I look forward to leveraging my experiences and skills in this dynamic role. While I'm fully committed to contributing to VESL Studio during the academic year, I am still actively seeking summer internships in Project Management. I'm eager to explore additional opportunities that can further enhance my understanding and experience in this field, building on the solid foundation I've established through my current role and academic pursuits.
